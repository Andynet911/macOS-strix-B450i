⚠️ **OpenCore is in beta. This configuration could have issues.**

🍀 **Looking for [Clover?](https://github.com/willza3/macOS-strix-B450i/tree/Clover)**

Tested with macOS Catalina 10.15.2 but should work with Mojave. All iCloud services are fully functional, but flush a new SMBIOS if you decide to use this. Rather than compiling directly from source, this configuration uses 0.5.2 - later versions have not been tested.

## What is OpenCore?
OpenCore is an open-source bootloader, designed to be an alternative to Clover. OpenCore aims to resolve the constraints and issues imposed by Clover by providing a more versatile and modular system. While OpenCore is primarily designed for Hackintosh systems, it can be used in any scenario where an emulated EFI is needed. Please remember that OpenCore is still new and currently in beta. Unless you want to be on the bleeding edge of Hackintosh development or are planning on contributing to the project, you probably don't want to migrate if you have a stable system currently.
