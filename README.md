‚ö†Ô∏è **OpenCore is currently in early development. This configuration may be unstable.**

üçÄ **Looking for [Clover?](https://github.com/willza3/macOS-strix-B450i/tree/master)**

## What is OpenCore?
OpenCore is an alternative to the Clover bootloader. By design, OpenCore is versatile by being more modular and open as it aims to resolve the constraints and issues that Clover brings. Please remember we‚Äôre still in very early infancy so there will be issues. OpenCore should be considered in Alpha stage at this time. If you have a working, stable system you should not migrate unless you prefer "bleeding edge" development, want to contribute, and don't mind recovering your system should it fail to boot.
