⚠️ **OpenCore is still in beta. Please keep this in mind.**

🔔 **Join the Telegram [Channel](https://t.me/macOSstrixB450i) for the latest updates.**      

Tested with macOS Catalina 10.15.3, but expected to work with Mojave 10.14. This configuration uses OpenCore 0.5.6 - any later releases of OpenCore have not yet been tested so use at your own risk.

This configuration works out the box with iCloud services, but it's **highly reccomended to [flush a new SMBIOS.](https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/amd-config.plist/amd-config#platforminfo)** Using the included SMBIOS could result in a blacklisted or permanently banned Apple ID.

## What is OpenCore?
OpenCore is an open-source unconventional first-in-class piece of software designed to intercept kernel loading to insert a highly advanced rootkit, designed to be an alternative to Clover. OpenCore aims to resolve the constraints and issues imposed by Clover by providing a more versatile and modular system. While OpenCore is primarily designed for Hackintosh systems, it can be used in any scenario where an emulated EFI is needed.
